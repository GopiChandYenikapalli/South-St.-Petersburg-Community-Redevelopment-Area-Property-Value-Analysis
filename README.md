# South St.Petersburg Community Redevelopment Area Property Value Analysis
### Background
The South St. Petersburg Community Redevelopment Area (CRA) was established in 2015 to promote reinvestment in housing and neighborhoods, commercial corridors, business development, and education and workforce development in the City of St. Petersburg.
The City seeks to understand historical trends related to property values since the adoption of the South St. Petersburg Community Redevelopment Plan. The purpose of this project is for students to analyze
and publish relevant data related to property values in specific areas of interest. The outcome of the project may influence the Cityâ€™s strategy related to investments in and around these areas of the City of
St. Petersburg. 
## Property Value Analysis in South St. Petersburg CRA: 
Conducted a detailed analysis of property values from 2015 to 2022 within the South St. Petersburg Community Redevelopment Area, focusing on the comparison of taxable values for properties on/north of 5th Avenue South and those south of it. This involved extensive data collection, processing, and analysis to understand historical trends and their implications on future city planning and investment strategies.

## Data Visualization and Trend Identification:
Developed comprehensive visualizations to illustrate the percentage increase in property values over time, differentiating between all properties and specific categories like non-residential and mixed-use properties. These visualizations were designed to effectively communicate complex data trends to stakeholders, aiding in strategic decision-making processes.

## Taxable Value Assessment and Reporting:
Assessed and reported on the total taxable property values for distinct zones (north/on and south of 5th Avenue South) in 2015 and 2022. This included calculating the overall growth in taxable value, thereby providing a clear financial impact analysis of the redevelopment efforts in the South St. Petersburg area.

## Strategic Insight and Decision Support:
Provided critical insights through a detailed property appraiser data analysis in 2022, comparing total taxable property values across different regions of the South St. Petersburg CRA. This analysis was further refined by controlling for variables such as the number of properties, acreage, and land square footage, thereby offering nuanced insights to support strategic planning and investment decisions by city officials and stakeholders.
